# The-Levenshtein-Distance-Algorithm
The Levenshtein Distance Algorithm



This is a basic implementation of the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm. 
First, populate the list "e_word" with a dictionary. 
Then, run the program and input a word. The algorithm will determine and indicate which word in the list matches your input the most closely.

Update:
Instead of using the "e_word" list to fill your entire dictionary, you will now be able to upload a text file directly.
Remember to change "data.txt" to your dictionary file.
