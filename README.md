The Levenshtein Distance Algorithm

This is a basic implementation of the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm. First, populate the list "stories.txt" with a dictionary. Then, run the program and input a word. The algorithm will determine and indicate which word in the list matches your input the most closely. It cannot take sentences, only one word. I may update it later to be able to handle sentences, but for now, I'm working on another project.

Update: Instead of using the "e_word" list to fill your entire dictionary, you will now be able to upload a text file directly. Remember to change "Stories.txt" to your dictionary file.
Btw i used gpt to add #comments so you can clearly see what i mean with each line
