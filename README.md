The Levenshtein Distance Algorithm



This is a basic implementation of the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm. 
First, populate the list "e_word" with a dictionary. 
Then, run the program and input a word. The algorithm will determine and indicate which word in the list matches your input the most closely.

I will soon update the program so that instead of using the "e_word" list, you will be able to upload a text file directly.
